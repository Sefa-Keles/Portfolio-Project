# PROJECT-1: PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
---
**PRESENTATION:**  
The responsive portfolio website design presented in this repository was created using the technologies taught in my training. It has been designed taking into account the principles of user friendliness and efficiency. The design allows the menu tabs in the navigation bar to work in sync with the content section. In this way, while navigating the menu, the content of the tab you click is displayed dynamically on the same page. It allows you to present your vision and experience effectively and to enable people or institutions that want to reach you to easily access and communicate through social media or other communication channels.

## Deployment
This website design was produced with the Visual Studio Code IDE. Git was used as the version control system and saved in GitHub repositories. I used the $git -init command to start this project. Then I used the git status code to check the status of the written codes, then git add so that my local repository could see the written codes. I used the command. I saved this file to our local repository by leaving a commit message with git commit - m "xxxxxxxxx". I performed the SSH-keygen operation before doing the push operation. Then I validated my attempt by using the new feature of github, token usage. As the last step, I applied the push operation and saved it to the remote repository. I will do these operations again in every development and update of the project.
